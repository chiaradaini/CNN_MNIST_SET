# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on CUDA

**Description:**

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on NVIDIA CUDA, using C++ and Python. It includes a convolution layer, max-pooling layer, and a fully connected layer for image classification tasks. The project is designed to process the MNIST dataset and make predictions.

The project is organized into three main folders:

- `CNN_MNIST_CPP`: Contains the C++ code implementation.
- `CNN_MNIST_PY`:  Contains the Python code implementation.
- `CNN_MNIST_CU`:  Contains the CUDA code implementation.
